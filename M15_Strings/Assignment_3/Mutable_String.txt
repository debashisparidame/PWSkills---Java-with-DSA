  1. What is mutable string in java explain with an example?

*/

Ans:-

In Java, mutable strings are represented by the StringBuilder and StringBuffer classes. Unlike String objects, which are immutable and cannot be changed once created, StringBuilder and StringBuffer objects can be modified after they are created.


Here's an example of a mutable string using StringBuilder:

// Create a StringBuilder object
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");

// Print the original string
System.out.println("Original StringBuilder: " + sb);

// Append to the StringBuilder
sb.append(" World");

// Print the modified StringBuilder
System.out.println("Modified StringBuilder: " + sb);
