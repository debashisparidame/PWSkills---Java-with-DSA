//4. How do you compare two strings in java?

Ans -

In Java, you can compare two strings in several ways:

Using the equals method: This method compares the content of the strings. It returns true if the strings are identical (same characters in the same order), and false otherwise.

Using the equalsIgnoreCase method: This method is similar to equals, but it ignores the case of the characters.

Using the compareTo method: This method compares the strings lexicographically (based on the Unicode value of the characters). It returns 0 if the strings are identical, a negative number if the first string comes before the second string, and a positive number if the first string comes after the second string.
